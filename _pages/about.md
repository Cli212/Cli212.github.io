I am a third-year PhD student in the [Autonomous Vision Group (AVG)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/) supervised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://www.cvlibs.net/) at Univeristy of T端bingen and T端bingen AI Center. 

My research interest originates with language modeling, driven by a deep curiosity in understanding how machines can learn to interact with human. My current research focuses on pushing the shift from traditional Transformer-based models under the 'linearization assumption (everything in the inputs is flattened)' to models that can use ubiquitous hierarchies effectively.

I am also interested in multimodal modeling, and I draw a lot of sustenance from our exceptional CV group. I feel that though current LLMs are powerful at retrieving knowledge, they are far from an autonomous agent, partially because the lack of understanding laws (e.g., Physics) of how the world operates, which other modalities (e.g., images) can be complementary.     

My ~~vision~~ naive dream for AI is to free humans to fully create and experience the way of life. Naturally, there are many obstacles along the way...
