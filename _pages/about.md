I am a second-year PhD student at [Autonomous Vision Group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/). My research interest originates with language modeling, driven by a deep curiosity in understanding how machines can learn and interpret human perception. My research focuses on developing advanced models that enhance machine comprehension and generation of text (and other modalities).

In addition to my work in language modeling, I am also passionate about multi-modal learning. Because I believe every image is a solution to the physical laws, therefore integrating multiple modalities—such as text and images can we build truly comprehensive world model.

My vision for AI is to free humans to fully experience and enjoy the process of life. Naturally, there are many obstacles along the way...
